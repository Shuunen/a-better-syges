# A Better Syges

Hello there :)

This is a work in progress but feel free to open issues for bugs & feature requests.

# What ?

A Better Syges (abs) aim to improve Syges UI & UX

# Why ?

Because, in my opinion, Syges UI ugly & bloatered.

Here is how it looks like with ABS actually :

# How ?

Abs will enhance Syges while you are browsing [https://sygesweb.niji.fr/](https://sygesweb.niji.fr/SYGESWEB/)

First, install [TamperMonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) or an alternative

Then the [ABS user script](https://greasyfork.org/fr/scripts/31837-a-better-syges) will do the customization for you.

# Develop locally

- Set this in your browser : `localStorage.absLocal = true`
- `yarn` & `yarn start`

This will serve abs.js & abs.css files and the user script will use your local files instead of those hosted on this repo

# Thanks
